# Gala Language Guide

Gala is designed to be familiar if you come from a C-style language.

---

## Types

Each value in Gala has a type. Currently the supported types are the following:

### Numeric

 * `int32`
 * `int64`
 * `float32`
 * `float64`
 * `bool`
 
### Strings 

 * `string` - unicode string

---

## Literals

### Numeric

 * `int32` and `int64` - Can be defined with binary, octal, decimal or hexadecimal literals.
    - Binary: `0b1010101`
    - Octal: `0644`
    - Decimal: `7618`
    - Hexadecimal: `0x1fad`
 * `float32` and `float64` - Can be defined in decimal only. Scientific notation is allowed.
    - `12.34` or `123.456e7`
 * `bool`
    - Either `true` or `false`

### Strings

String are surrounded by single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes. Examples of string literals are

```
'I am a string - I can contain any character, such as æ™®'
"I am another string"
```

Strings are always unicode, therefore you can put any characters in them.

If you want to put a quote in a string, you can use a slash `\` to escape them. Double the slash
to escape the slash itself.

```
'I\'m fine with slashes!'
"This is what can be called a \"string\""
'This is a slash: \\'
```

Here are some special escapes for common carachters:

```
'This is a line\nAnd this another'
'\tThis line has a tab before'
'This is a carriage return: \r'
'This a backspace: \b'
'This a form feed: \f'
```

You can also input any unicode characters in decimal or hexadecimal as follows:

```
'This is the letter a: \97'
'This is again the letter a: \x61'
'Yet again the letter a: \u61'
```

---

## Variables

Variables are declared with the Go-like syntax `variable_name type`. For example:

```
year int32 = 2018;
load float32 = 0.57;
passed bool = true;
```

## Expressions

Expressions are combinations of constants literals, variables operators and functions
that has a value. An example of an expression is a sum like `3 + 4`. Other example include:

```
7 * 8
(variable + 17) / 8
var1 or var2
```

Gala supports many standard operators, which are listed below.

### Mathematical operators

 * `+` and `-` - sum and difference
 * `*` and `/` - product and quotient
 * `%` - modulo or remainder
 * `-` - negation as in `-2` or `-height`
 * `**` - elevation to power as in `2**3 = 8`

### Logical operators

These

 * `and`
 * `or`
 * `not`
 * `==` - equality
 * `!=` - inequality
 * `<` and `<=` - less and less than
 * `>` and `>=` - greater and greater than
 
## Object operators

 * `.` - access property
 * `[]` - indexing
 * `()` - function call
 
### Bitwise operators

 * `&` - bitwise and
 * `^` - bitwise xor
 * `|` - bitwise or
 * `~` - bitwise negation or bit flipping

Bitshifting is not (yet) supported

### Ternary operator

Not supported

### Operator precedence

Operators have precedence as follows (first has precedence on last):

| Precedence    | Operator      |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| 1      | `()` |
| 2      | `[]` |
| 3      | `.` |
| 4      | `-` |
| 5      | `~` |
| 6      | `not` |
| 7      | `**` |
| 8      | `%` |
| 9      | `*`, `/` |
| 10     | `+`, `-` |
| 11     | `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=` |
| 12     | `==`, `!=` |
| 13     | `&` |
| 14     | `^` |
| 15     | `|` |
| 16     | `and` |
| 17     | `or` |

## Statements

Gala supports common conditionals and loops statements.

### Conditionals

The most common conditional is the if/else statement, which in Gala is exactly like in many
other languages:

```
if (condition1) {
    ...
} else if (condition2) {
    ...
} else {
    ...
}
```

You can also remove the parenthesis:

```
if (condition) a = 1;
```

## Functions

Functions are defined as follows

```
fun function_name(arg1 type1, arg2 type2) return_type {
    ...
}
```

Putting the type after the identifier is a bit different from other C-style languages,
but is clear to read and remains readable even for function types.
The type signature of the function will be:

```
fun (type1, type2) return_type
```

which can be read as "a function that takes `type1` and `type2` and returns `return_type`".

### Return statement

To return a value from a function, use the return statement:

```
fun generate_a_one() int32 {
    return 1;
}
```

### Function invocation

To call a function and get the result, use the invocation syntax:

```
one inte32 = generate_a_one();
```


## Main function

> This feature may change in future releases, because it's not very suitable for scripting.

Just like C, Gala uses a `main` function as entry-point for a program.
A valid Gala program always has one and only one main function.
Here an example of a valid Gala program:

```
fun main() int32 {
    // This is a complete program. Useless but complete.
}
```

## Comments

Comments can have two different forms: line comments start with `//` and continue
to the end of the line, while block comments start with `/*` and end with `*/` and
can span multiple lines. Examples:

```
year int32 = 2018; // this part is ignored
load float32 = /* you should not put comments in such a place, but yeah it works */ 0.57;

/*
 * This is a boring function that always returns 1.
 * 
 * As such it's totally useless.
 */
fun generate_a_one() int32 {
    return 1;
}

```
